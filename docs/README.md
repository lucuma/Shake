# Shake documentation

These are the guides for Shake 1.2. They are designed to make you immediately productive with Shake, and to help you understand how all of the pieces fit together.



## About the Documentation

This documentation was generated using [Clay] (http://lucuma.github.com/Clay/). The sources are in the `source` dir, and the html version is in `build/html`.

### How to regenerate

First, install clay, markdown and pygments.

    $ pip install clay markdown pygments

Run the development server with:

    $ clay run

or generate a new html version of the documentation by doing:

    $ clay build

The guides are written in [Markdown syntax] (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). “Markdown” is a plain text formatting syntax designed to make it as readable as possible. You can write it in the text editor of your choice, many of them even come with highlighting support for  Markdown syntax.
